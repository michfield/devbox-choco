      This package performs miscellaneous actions to customize your command line experience.

      1. Set environment variable « chocolatey_bin_root » to C:\Tools, only if it's not already set. Some packages that would otherwise install into system root will look for this variable. Packages that behave in this way are: Ruby, Python etc - almost any package that is not comfortable with spaces in filenames.
      2. Permanently sets HOME environment variable to a valid value, if not already set.
      3. Installs « setenv » command that refreshes environment variables without the need to restart command shell. Sometimes very useful.
      4. Establishes a flexible system of auto-run include files, specified in user's home directory. After that, any file residing in home directory looking like « .bashrc.include.*.bat » gets auto-executed at every command shell start.

      Automatic uninstall procedure is included in this package, so you don't need to manually reverse whatever actions installer did. This procedure will unset « chocolatey_bin_root » variable (1.) but will not do anything to remove effects of (2.), (3.) and (4.) because these settings are very unobtrusive.

      NOTE: Phrase « Devbox » in a name of this package is used as signature to indicate high quality standards. Functionally, the package is the same as any other Chocolatey package.
