      Git settings for Windows by modifying global .gitconfig file. Package is unobtrusive - settings are changed only if they were not set before or have been set to default value.

      1. Core editor is set to: Notepad++, Notepad2 or Notepad, in that order, whichever application is detected on a system.
      2. Diff and merge tool are set to: P4Merge, DiffMerge, in that order, whichever is installed.
      3. Miscellaneous Git settings. Changes are applied only if setting is not already set.
      3. Git aliases. Changes are applied only if alias is not already set.
      4. Environment variable TERM set to 'linux', if not set already, to fix annoying warnings.

      NOTE: There is no automatic uninstall procedure included with this package, so you will have to manually revert changes in global .gitconfig file.
      NOTE: Phrase « Devbox » in a name of this package is used as signature to indicate high quality standards. Functionally, the package is the same as any other Chocolatey package.
