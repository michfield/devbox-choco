    <description>
      Notepad2 is a light-weight (only ~350 KB), free and open source Notepad-like text editor with syntax highlighting for a few commonly used languages. It's based on the Scintilla source code editing component and works on NT-based versions of Windows.
      Features: Syntax highlighting, Basic regular expression search and replace, Rectangular selection (Alt+Mouse), Support for Unicode, UTF-8, Unix and Mac text files
      NOTE: Notepad2 installs itself by replacing regular Notepad. Therefore launching Notepad2 is the same as executing Notepad.
      NOTE: Automatic uninstall procedure is included in this package, so you don't need to manually reverse whatever actions installer did.
      NOTE: Phrase « Devbox » in a name of this package is used as signature to indicate high quality standards. Functionally, the package is the same as any other Chocolatey package.
